# Motion Detection System with PIR Sensor

## Overview

This Arduino project utilizes a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor and a buzzer to detect motion. When motion is detected, the buzzer is activated. Serial communication is employed for debugging purposes.

## Components

- PIR Sensor
- Buzzer
- Arduino Board

## Pin Configuration

- PIR Sensor Output: Pin 2
- Buzzer Control: Pin 3

## Usage

1. The system initializes and waits for motion detection.
2. When motion is detected, the buzzer activates.
3. Serial communication provides real-time PIR sensor states for debugging.

Feel free to modify the code as needed for your specific requirements.
